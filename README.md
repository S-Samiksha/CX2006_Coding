# READ THIS!!!!
i have changes the names of the files to follow the initial dialog map. Pls refer to the pdf submitted and the following for reference: 
main page is before the register or login <br>

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dIuQCkmmF8AWjBT9cTfn94fV4n_XEfiyTaNp6yWQWBk/edit
<br>
I also split further and further to make it very clear the different pages. I know they can be the same code or can be merged but we can discuss that later. 

I also put inside folder: so many css and html files ><

## Lab 3 Submission (documentation)
### **13 OCT 12 PM**

1. System Architecture **Junhan, Marcus, Samiksha**  
2. State machine diagram **Junhan, Marcus, Samiksha**  

*For all the below stuff, most are from the TA's feedback and the existing pdf we sent in for lab. Check onedrive>lab 3 submission. follow the images in the pdf and make a new .vpp file and send. also help edit the landlord database thingy about the rental flats and sending to all the landlords (discussed in the meeting on 24 sept)*

*I uploaded the .vpp file containing all the use case, dialog map, class diagram. We just need to **update** it.*



2. class diagram .vpp needed follow the pdf **Arushi** 
3. Edit the use case (change the landlord and follow the pdf)  

   >*UC001 to UC004*: **Melise**  <br>
   >*UC005 to UC009*: **Anagha**  <br>

4. sequence diagram any changes all the changes  **Arushi**  <br>
5. Dialog Map **Anagha**  <br>
6. use case diagram **Samiksha**  <br>
7. font size, font type, the details basically **Marcus**   <br>


#### Checking 15 Oct 12pm
**Melise - Anagha:** double check each other use case <br>
**junhan:** check the diagrams (class diagram, sequence diagram) <br>
**marcus:** check the diagrams (use case diagram, initial dialog map) <br>
**samiksha:** compile the front end code into github, .vpp files, and document for submission and check the system architecture <br>


I need yall to upload the .vpp files to github<br>

## Discussion stuff (add on here)

*The diagrams*
Just put here first for reference later:
1. make sure the class diagram is coherent with the use case
2. all diagrams need to be coherent. 
3. proper class diagram with the proper number of relationships (one to many, many to one, one to one)
4. think about parent class, subclasses 
5. noun: classes
6. verb: operation
7. idk??? all entity classes must be in data dictionary?? lecture note 7 slide 20?
8. do not need sequence diagram for all. the minor classes dont need 
9. sequence diagram no line from boundary back to actor 
10. actually how long is the activation bar supposed to be?
11. do we really need a communication diagram ><
12. visual paradigm can convert from sequence to communication diagram. but why have a communication diagram in the first place??? :(
13. UML sequence and class diagram have to match the coding??? ~from both OOP lectures and 2006 lectures technically html is a OOP language we change the file names, the inside variables to match UML class diagram and sequence diagram --> discuss?
14. **References**, if you copied code, change a bit, and add the references below
15. and why is oop lecture more clearer? maybe we should follow that properly and make sure it is correct? 
16. Navigation bar standardize (center or left align?)
17. standardize the fonts, buttons, design in general, heading swip animation, all animations, heading photos etc. 
18. if we want we can restrict to a certain screen size aka say 786px to 1020px. so we dont have to even account for smaller sizes. then less work. then put it inside the documentation the intro part the restrictions part thing
19. How to do SQL...? A lot of us are unfamiliar so either we sit down every week before the deadline do 5 hours / week. or we have one day 12 hours sit down code or we otot by watching online video. (doing tgt just mean if we have error can just ask immediately, and also if restrictions ease we can meet ftf)
20. Lab 4 delegation: what do we need to do for lab 4, how to do it, who is doing it etc. 
21. UI mockup to match actual coding to match use case (e.g. jerry tom, the number of things to input in the form for update roommate/self preference, recommendation system coding, etc. )
