1. Make sure ALL diagrams are coherent when reading, meaning the functions and class diagrams and the use case diagram, use case all match match (ensure it accommodates the stuff the TA said)  update according to the pdf

> UC001 to UC004 (table and sequence): 
> UC005 to UC0010 (table and sequence): 
> Intial Dialog:
> UML: 

--

All the new stuff
also finalize within your own "micro" group if everyone (all 6 people) checks we will take forever. 

2. New class diagram   (One take Control, one take entity, one take boundary respectively once the first person is done, just update to github and pass on) --> many to one, one to one etc. 

3. Make the system architecture 

4. Make the state machine (take intial dialog convert to even more boring form)

5. Make the communication diagram  (Split 50/50, iirc each sequence diagram got one communication)

6. Make the activity diagram  (take state machine to even more boring form its the same and yet just more boring)

7. Do video scripting  (cuz need to screen record)

8. Do the video 

9. Data dictionary finalize   (split 50/50)

10. UI mockup compile the final one and explain based on the use case.  (split 50/50)
