*The diagrams*
Just put here first for reference later:
1. make sure the class diagram is coherent with the use case
2. all diagrams need to be coherent. 
3. proper class diagram with the proper number of relationships (one to many, many to one, one to one)
4. think about parent class, subclasses 
5. noun: classes
6. verb: operation
7. idk??? all entity classes must be in data dictionary?? lecture note 7 slide 20?
8. do not need sequence diagram for all. the minor classes dont need 
9. sequence diagram no line from boundary back to actor 
10. actually how long is the activation bar supposed to be?
